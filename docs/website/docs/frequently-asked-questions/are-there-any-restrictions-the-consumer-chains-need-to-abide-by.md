# Are there any restrictions the consumer chains need to abide by?

**No.**
Consumer chains are free to choose how they wish to operate, which modules to include, use CosmWASM in a permissioned or a permissionless way.
The only thing that separates consumer chains from sovereign chains is that they share their validator set with the provider chain.
