# What even is a consumer chain?


Consumer chain is blockchain operated by the same the same validator operators as the provider chain. The ICS protocol ensures the validator set replication properties (informs consumer chain about the current state of the validator set on the provider)

Consumer chains are run on infrastructure (virtual or phyisical machines) distinct from the provider, have their own configurations and operating requirements.
