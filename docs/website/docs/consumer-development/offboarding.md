# Consumer Offboarding

To offboard a consumer chain simply submit a consumer removal proposal listing a `stop_time`. After stop time passes, the provider chain will remove the chain from the ICS protocol (it will stop sending validator set updates).

More information will be listed in a future version of this document.
